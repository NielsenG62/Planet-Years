## Description

_This application is pretty simple. It takes user input for age and planet, and tells them their planet age, and how many years left until they hit the average life expectancy of 75 (earth years). This is calculated by taking the amount of earth days it takes for a planet to circle the sun, and comparing it to how many earth days you have lived._
